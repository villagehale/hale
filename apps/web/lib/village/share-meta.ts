/**
 * The share-preview metadata for the three PUBLIC artifacts (rule #1). This is
 * what a pasted /w, /picks, or /a link renders as in WhatsApp/iMessage/Slack, so
 * it must be share-SPECIFIC — the idea count and coarse area, or the pick's own
 * public title — never the generic site tagline the root layout carries.
 *
 * The inputs are ONLY the already-redacted public payloads (coarse area, safe
 * capped title/kind, aggregate count). No child name, DOB, precise location, or
 * parent identity is reachable here — they aren't in the props — so no builder
 * can leak PII by construction. A null payload (revoked/expired/no-DB) returns a
 * benign branded fallback so a dead link previews cleanly instead of crashing or
 * inheriting the generic tagline.
 *
 * The file-based `opengraph-image.tsx` per route supplies og:image via the Next
 * convention, so these builders deliberately do NOT set openGraph.images.
